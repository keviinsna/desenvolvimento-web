        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p style="color: white">
          The Pug is a breed of dog originally from China, with physically
          distinctive features of a wrinkly, short-muzzled face and curled tail.
          The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes in a variety of colors,
          most often light brown (fawn) or black, and a compact, square body
          with well developed and thick muscles all over the body.

          Pugs are known for being sociable and gentle companion dogs. The
          American Kennel Club describes the breed's personality as
          "even-tempered and charming". Pugs remain popular into the
          twenty-first century, with some famous celebrity owners.

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          While the pugs that are depicted in eighteenth century prints tend to
          be long and lean, modern breed preferences are for a square cobby
          body, a compact form, a deep chest, and well-developed muscle. Their
          smooth and glossy coats can be fawn, apricot fawn, silver fawn, or
          black. The markings are clearly defined and there is a trace of a
          black line extending from the occiput to the tail. The tail normally
          curls tightly over the hip.

          Pugs have two distinct shapes for their ears, "rose" and "button".
          "Rose" ears are smaller than the standard style of "button" ears, and
          are folded with the front edge against the side of the head. Breeding
          preference goes to "button" style ears.
