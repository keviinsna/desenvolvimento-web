        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Pug is a breed of dog originally from China, with physically
          distinctive features of a wrinkly, short-muzzled face and curled tail.
          The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes in a variety of colors,
          most often light brown (fawn) or black, and a compact, square body
          with well developed and thick muscles all over the body.

          Pugs are known for being sociable and gentle companion dogs. The
          American Kennel Club describes the breed's personality as
          "even-tempered and charming". Pugs remain popular into the
          twenty-first century, with some famous celebrity owners.

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          While the pugs that are depicted in eighteenth century prints tend to
          be long and lean, modern breed preferences are for a square cobby
          body, a compact form, a deep chest, and well-developed muscle. Their
          smooth and glossy coats can be fawn, apricot fawn, silver fawn, or
          black. The markings are clearly defined and there is a trace of a
          black line extending from the occiput to the tail. The tail normally
          curls tightly over the hip.

          Pugs have two distinct shapes for their ears, "rose" and "button".
          "Rose" ears are smaller than the standard style of "button" ears, and
          are folded with the front edge against the side of the head. Breeding
          preference goes to "button" style ears.
        </p>

          This breed is often described by the Latin phrase multum in parvo, or
          "much in little" or "a lot of dog in a small space", alluding to the
          pug's remarkable and charming personality, despite its small size.
          Pugs are strong-willed but rarely aggressive, and are suitable for
          families with children. The majority of the breed is very fond of
          children and sturdy enough to properly play with them. Depending on
          their owner's mood, they can be quiet and docile but also vivacious
          and teasing.Pugs tend to be intuitive and sensitive to the moods of
          their owners and are usually eager to please them.Pugs are playful and
          thrive on human companionship. They also tend to have a snoozy nature
          and spend a lot of time napping. Pugs are often called "shadows"
          because they follow their owners around and like to stay close to the
          action, craving attention and affection from their owners.

        <h2>Brief history</h2>
        <p>
          The Pug, often called the Pug Dog, is an ancient breed that can be
          traced back some 2,000 years. The emperors of ancient China had a
          preference for flat-faced toy dogs—the Pekingese, Shih Tzu, and Pug
          were all developed as refined pets of the emperor, his family, and
          members of the imperial court. Like many breeds favored by Far Eastern
          potentates of the ancient world, Pugs were a closely held treasure
          that outsiders could acquire only as a gift.

          The Pug’s career as citizen of the world began sometime in the 1500s,
          when Dutch traders returned to Europe with specimens of the breed.
          Legend holds that the Pug became the mascot of Holland’s royal House
          of Orange when a Pug save the life of the Prince of Orange by barking
          to warn the prince of an attack on his camp by Spanish troops. When
          William and Mary of Orange arrived in England to assume the monarchy,
          their Pugs accompanied them and began a craze for the breed among the
          British.
        </p>
        <p>
          The worldwide fascination with Pugs can be gauged by how many names
          the breed has had in various eras and places: Lo-sze (China), Mopsi
          (Finland), Doguillo (Spain) are just a few. Among the Dutch, still
          closely associated with Pugs, they are known as Mophonds.
        </p>

          Theories abound as to the origin of the name Pug. One suggests that
          Pug is based on the Latin word “pugnus,” meaning “fist”—the idea being
          that the dog’s face resembles a clenched fist.
