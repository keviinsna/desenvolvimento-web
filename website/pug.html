        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Pug is a breed of dog originally from China, with physically
          distinctive features of a wrinkly, short-muzzled face and curled tail.
          The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes in a variety of colors,
          most often light brown (fawn) or black, and a compact, square body
          with well developed and thick muscles all over the body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pugs are known for being sociable and gentle companion dogs. The
          American Kennel Club describes the breed's personality as
          "even-tempered and charming". Pugs remain popular into the
          twenty-first century, with some famous celebrity owners.

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          While the pugs that are depicted in eighteenth century prints tend to
          be long and lean, modern breed preferences are for a square cobby
          body, a compact form, a deep chest, and well-developed muscle. Their
          smooth and glossy coats can be fawn, apricot fawn, silver fawn, or
          black. The markings are clearly defined and there is a trace of a
          black line extending from the occiput to the tail. The tail normally
          curls tightly over the hip.
        </p>

          Pugs have two distinct shapes for their ears, "rose" and "button".
          "Rose" ears are smaller than the standard style of "button" ears, and
          are folded with the front edge against the side of the head. Breeding
          preference goes to "button" style ears.
        </p>
        <p>
          This breed is often described by the Latin phrase multum in parvo, or
          "much in little" or "a lot of dog in a small space", alluding to the
          pug's remarkable and charming personality, despite its small size.
          Pugs are strong-willed but rarely aggressive, and are suitable for
          families with children. The majority of the breed is very fond of
          children and sturdy enough to properly play with them. Depending on
          their owner's mood, they can be quiet and docile but also vivacious
          and teasing.Pugs tend to be intuitive and sensitive to the moods of
          their owners and are usually eager to please them.Pugs are playful and
          thrive on human companionship. They also tend to have a snoozy nature
          and spend a lot of time napping. Pugs are often called "shadows"
          because they follow their owners around and like to stay close to the
          action, craving attention and affection from their owners.

        <h2>Health Problems</h2>
        <p>
          Pugs are prone to many health issues. Most are related to their
          brachycephalic conformation. Fortunately, many of their potential
          health problems can be managed with the assistance of your
          veterinarian.
        </p>
        <div id="problems">
          <div class="row">
            <div id="respiratory-distress">
              <h4>Respiratory Distress</h4>
              <p>
                The narrow airway of a Pug also means that they are more prone
                to respiratory distress.
              </p>
              <p>
                If your Pug becomes stressed or distressed, they breathe even
                harder. This harsh breathing causes their already narrow airways
                to collapse further, which makes it even harder for them to
                breathe.
              </p>
              <p>
                Without intervention, this can progress to the point of low
                oxygen levels and collapse.
              </p>
              <p>
                Avoiding stress and keeping your Pug calm can help to avoid true
                respiratory distress. If you are noticing heavy or distressed
                breathing, contact your veterinarian or an emergency vet clinic
                immediately.
              </p>
              <p>
                To help your Pug breathe more easily, your veterinarian may
                recommend surgery to widen the Pug’s narrow nostrils airway
                early in life. This is a simple procedure that can be done at
                the same time as spay or neuter surgery.

              <h4>Dental Disease</h4>
              <div>
                <p>
                  Pugs have small jaws, but they have the same number of teeth
                  as other dog breeds. As a result, many of their teeth are
                  crooked and crowded.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Just like in people, crowded and crooked teeth can lead to
                  increased buildup of food between their teeth. The result is
                  increased risk for gingivitis, infection, and dental disease.
                  Over time, this can lead to tooth loss and pain.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Daily tooth brushing is key to control and prevent
                  inflammation. In addition, annual dental cleanings under
                  anesthesia by your veterinarian starting at 1–2 years of age
                  will help to identify infection and periodontal disease early.
                  Ultimately, diseased teeth should be removed as early as
                  possible to avoid pain, but diligent dental care can help
                  prevent tooth loss.
                </p>

            <div id="overheating">
              <h4>Overheating</h4>
              <p>
                Because they are a brachycephalic breed, Pugs’ upper respiratory
                tract is much smaller than other dogs, so they often have to
                breathe through their mouths.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since dogs use their airways to cool themselves, this increased
                effort for Pugs leaves them more predisposed to overheating.
              </p>
              <p>To keep your Pug safe, follow these guidelines:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Avoid taking your Pug outside during the hottest parts of the
                  day
                </li>
                <li>
                  Avoid strenuous exercise for your Pug during hot weather
                </li>
                <li>Provide consistent access to cool, clean water</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Excess weight can increase breathing difficulties and make it
                easier for a Pug to overheat. Keeping your Pug at a healthy
                weight or on a weight-control diet to prevent obesity—when
                prescribed by a veterinarian—will help minimize risk.

              <div>
                <p>
                  A problem that is unique to Pugs is the risk of eye injury.
                  The shape of the Pug’s skull makes their eye sockets very
                  shallow, which means their eyelids are often not big enough to
                  completely close. As a result, it’s easy for their eyes to get
                  scratched, punctured, or even pop out.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All of these constitute an emergency, and your pet should be
                  taken to the vet immediately. Without rapid treatment, these
                  injuries can result in permanent damage or even loss of an
                  eye.
